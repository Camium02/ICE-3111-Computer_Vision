- What is the image size in mm?
- What is the image size in pixels?
- What is the data type used to store pixels? in other words, you must specify:
    - greyscale vs. colour
    - integer vs. floating point numbers
        - if integer, signed or unsigned,
        - if floating point numbers, single or double precision
    - how many bits per pixels
- What is the image size in number of bytes?
    - The total number of pixels is $\text{width in pixels} \times \text{height in pixels}$.
    - The number of values per pixel is 1 for greyscale images; 3 or 4 for colour images.
    - $\text{number of pixels} \times \text{bits per pixels} \times{number of values per pixel}/ 8 $
- How many different pixels values an 8-bit image can have?
- How many different pixels values DX000000 can have (in theory)?
- What is the "size of a pixel in mm"? (divide the image size in mm by the image size in pixels)
