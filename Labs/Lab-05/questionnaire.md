- Your name: \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
- Your user ID: \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_


**NOTE: When you add a listing in a report, you must format it properly!**
- Use a monotype font so that it is easily readable (e.g. Lucida Sans Console or Courier New). This means that all letters take up the same space on the page;
- Indent the code; and
- Use (colour) syntax highlighting.
- Show line numbers (optional)


# 1. Gaussian filtering

## A bit of theory

- Is a Gaussian filter a point operator? [1 mark]
    - YES/NO

- Is a Gaussian filter a linear filter? [1 mark]
    - YES/NO

- Is a Gaussian filter a convolution filter? [1 mark]
    - YES/NO

- Explain in your own terms the main difference(s) between a point operator and a convolution filter. [3 marks]

# 2. Image sharpening

- Step 13 of Lab script: include evidence of testing, e.g. sharpening two different images. Use the default value of `filter_radius` and `alpha`.
