## Introduction

Look at the ellipses in the mindmap. It illustrates which concepts we are discussing this week.

![Week 32 mindmap](../../mindmap/Week-03/screenshot.png)

This week we studied point operators in the lecture.
For example, we saw how to improve the contrast of an image that is dull using a simple, but powerful, technique called "histogram stretching" (also called min-max normalisation).

Today we will:

1. Install OpenCV is needed:
  - Either use C/C++, or,
  - Python.
2. Load an image.
3. Display an image.
4. Convert a RGB image in a greyscale image.
5. Find the smallest and largest pixel values in an image.
6. Improve the contrast of an image:
  - by hand using the equation seen in the lecture,
  - using OpenCV's function.
7. Change the dynamic range using a log transform.
8. Blend two images in a for loop to create an animation.


## Preliminaries



## Don't forget

To complete the lab report and to submit it.

## Next week

We will use spatial filters to blur an image, find edges, etc.
