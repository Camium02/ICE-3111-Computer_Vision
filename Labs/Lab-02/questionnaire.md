## Improving the Brightness and Contrast of the Visualisation

- Once you're happy with the brightness/contrast of your image,
  - Write down the numerical values that are below the histogram in the dialogue box ("B&C").
      - Smallest value:  \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ [1 mark]
      - largest value:  \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ [1 mark]
  - Put a screenshot of your image below: [1 mark]

## Area Measurements of an Object

- What is the area of the entire PMMA block in mm<sup>2</sup>?
    - Area:  \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ [1 mark]
- Look at your histograms from last week's report.
    - What was the max pixel value of the background?  \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ [1 mark]
    - What was the min pixel value of the PMMA block?  \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ [1 mark]
    - What is the pixel value in the middle?  \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ [1 mark]
- Add a screenshot below of your image after you segmented the PMMA block and removed the text "4cm PMMA" from the selection. [1 mark]
- Below the histogram in the threshold dialog box, you see a percentage. What is it?
  -  \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ [1 mark]
- Estimate the area of the PMMA block in mm<sup>2</sup> using this percentage.
  -  \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ [1 mark]
- How does it compare with your previous estimation?
    - Error in %: \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ [1 mark]
    - Looking at the segmented image, explain in your own words why the value you computed is greater than 0. [3 marks]
